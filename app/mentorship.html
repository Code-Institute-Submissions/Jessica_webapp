      <h2>Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from my own writing, my professional career to date has been concerned with writer development. I very much enjoy working with aspiring, emerging and established writers both in a group setting or one-to-one. I’ve given workshops to groups at various events around Ireland, and am always keen to take on new engagements.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Have a look at the options below and get in touch if you’d like to explore any of them in further detail, or to invite me to give a workshop at your festival or event.
      </p>

      <h3>Mentorship</h3>

      <p>
        I offer one-to-one mentorship on poetry and plays through the Irish Writers Centre. You can find details here.

        I also offer a play-reading service through Big Smoke Writing Factory.

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        <em>
          <q>This course has inspired me. It has given me tools to improve my writing. It has made me want to write and made me believe in myself as a possible writer.</q> 
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          <q>The course was a great introduction to writing poetry and to finding your creative voice. As someone who hadn't done much creative writing in the past, I thought Jessica was able to cater to everyone's needs in class and help me build some confidence to write (and especially the catalyst to start writing!) I'd definitely recommend to people who want some encouragement to start writing more and to find a group of like-minded people.</q>
